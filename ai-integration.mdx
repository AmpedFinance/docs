# AI Integration: Pioneering DeFAI

Amped Finance is at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized finance, creating what we call "DeFAI" - a harmonious blend of DeFi protocols with AI-driven intelligence. Our AI initiatives span from liquidity management to user-facing trading agents, positioning Amped as a leader in autonomous, intelligent financial systems.

## Current AI Implementations

### HeyAnon Integration

Amped has partnered with HeyAnon to bring AI-powered trading capabilities to our platform:

- **Natural Language Trading**: Users can execute trades using conversational commands
- **Market Analysis**: AI-driven insights and market analysis integrated into the trading experience

## Developer Tools: MCP Server & SDK

Amped is building comprehensive developer tools to enable AI protocols to interface with our liquidity and trading engine:

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server

Our MCP server provides:
- **Standardized API**: Consistent interface for AI agents to interact with Amped
- **Real-time Data Feeds**: Market data, liquidity metrics, and position information
- **Execution Endpoints**: Direct access to trading and liquidity provision functions

### Amped AI SDK

The SDK enables developers to:
- **Build Custom Agents**: Create specialized trading bots and strategies
- **Access Liquidity**: Tap into Amped's deep liquidity pools programmatically
- **Leverage Trading**: Execute leveraged positions through AI logic
- **Risk Management**: Implement automated risk controls and position limits

#### SDK Features
```javascript
// Example SDK usage
const ampedSDK = new AmpedSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  network: 'lightlink'
});

// AI agent can execute trades
const position = await ampedSDK.openPosition({
  asset: 'ETH',
  size: 1000,
  leverage: 5,
  direction: 'long',
  stopLoss: 0.95,
  takeProfit: 1.10
});

// Monitor and manage positions
const analysis = await ampedSDK.analyzePosition(position.id);
```
