# ðŸ”¬ Security

Security is of paramount importance to Amped Finance. As a DeFi platform handling significant user funds and executing complex financial contracts, Amped employs a multi-layered security strategy.

## Audited, Proven Codebase

The Amped Finance contracts are a fork of GMX v1's repository with minimal modifications. By starting from this reliable code foundation, which has been extensively audited and battle-tested on mainnet, Amped reduced the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities.
