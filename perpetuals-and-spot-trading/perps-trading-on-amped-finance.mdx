# Perpetual Trading on Amped Finance

Amped Finance allows you to trade perpetuals in a permissionless, decentralized, and non-custodial way. This tool is currently available on LightLink, and allows you to trade long and short with leverage ranging from 1.10x to 100x on ETH and BTC. You can open positions using collateral such as WBTC, ETH, USDC and USDT.

You only need a cryptocurrency wallet, such as Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Exodus, Trust Wallet, or WalletConnect, and some ETH to start trading.

### Partial Liquidations

The Liquidation Price is the price at which your collateral minus losses and borrow fees falls below 1% of your position size. Monitor this carefully as it changes over time due to borrow fees, especially with high leverage positions held for extended periods.

If liquidation occurs, any remaining collateral after deducting losses and fees will be returned to your wallet.
