## Overview

ALP constitutes an index of assets employed in swaps and leveraged trading on Amped. It's minted by using any index asset and can be redeemed by burning for any index asset. The minting and redemption prices are determined by the formula: (total value of assets in the index, including profits and losses of open positions) / (ALP supply).
