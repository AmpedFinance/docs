# Holding AMP

Liquidity providers (ALP Holders) and AMP holders benefit from long-term yields through a combination of esAMP and multiplier points, both backed by real returns generated from platform operating fees.

## esAMP (Escrowed AMP)

Escrowed AMP (esAMP) serves two primary functions within the protocol:

1. It can be staked to earn yield in esAMP
2. It can be vested to become AMP token after a one-year period

When staked, each esAMP token offers a yield equivalent to AMP in both esAMP and ETH rewards.

### Differences from AMP

While esAMP and AMP offer the same advantages in terms of yields on the Amped platform, esAMP is not a transferable token like AMP. To become AMP tokens, esAMP must first be locked for a one-year period. The locked tokens automatically convert to AMP tokens in your account after the lock-up period.

### Vesting Process

To convert esAMP into AMP:
1. Lock tokens in the vault on the Earn page
2. The average amount staked to acquire them will be reserved
3. Conversion occurs continuously over 365 days

Example: If you stake 1000 AMP tokens and receive 80 esAMP, locking these 80 esAMP will reserve 800 AMP. The esAMP tokens in the vault no longer participate in staking but convert to AMP every second over 365 days. Reserved AMP continues earning yields in esAMP and ETH.

**Important**: You must possess AMP to stake your esAMP. If you have esAMP without owning AMP, you will need to acquire AMP first.

## Multiplier Points

Multiplier points reward long-term AMP/esAMP holders without creating inflation for AMP.

### How They Work

- Fixed 100% yield rate
- Earned every second during staking
- Each point offers the same ETH yield as AMP
- Points burn proportionally when AMP is withdrawn: (AMP withdrawals / Total AMP * Total multiplier points)

### Boost Percentage

Multiplier points can significantly boost your APR:

Example:
- $1000 worth of AMP with 10% ETH yield = $100 in ETH
- 20% multiplier points = additional $20 in ETH (20% boost)
- Maximum boost percentage: 200%
