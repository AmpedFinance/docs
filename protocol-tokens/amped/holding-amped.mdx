# Holding AMPED

Liquidity providers (ALP Holders) and AMPED holders benefit from long-term yields through a combination of esAMP and multiplier points, both backed by real returns generated from platform operating fees.

## esAMP (Escrowed AMPED)

Escrowed AMPED (esAMP) serves two primary functions within the protocol:

1. It can be staked to earn yield in esAMP
2. It can be vested to become AMPED token after a one-year period

When staked, each esAMP token offers a yield equivalent to AMPED in both esAMP and ETH rewards.

### Differences from AMPED

While esAMP and AMPED offer the same advantages in terms of yields on the Amped platform, esAMP is not a transferable token like AMPED. To become AMPED tokens, esAMP must first be locked for a one-year period. The locked tokens automatically convert to AMPED tokens in your account after the lock-up period.

### Vesting Process

To convert esAMP into AMPED:
1. Lock tokens in the vault on the Earn page
2. The average amount staked to acquire them will be reserved
3. Conversion occurs continuously over 365 days

Example: If you stake 1000 AMPED tokens and receive 80 esAMP, locking these 80 esAMP will reserve 800 AMPED. The esAMP tokens in the vault no longer participate in staking but convert to AMPED every second over 365 days. Reserved AMPED continues earning yields in esAMP and ETH.

**Important**: You must possess AMPED to stake your esAMP. If you have esAMP without owning AMPED, you will need to acquire AMPED first.

## Multiplier Points

Multiplier points reward long-term AMPED/esAMP holders without creating inflation for AMPED.

### How They Work

- Fixed 100% yield rate
- Earned every second during staking
- Each point offers the same ETH yield as AMPED
- Points burn proportionally when AMPED is withdrawn: (AMPED withdrawals / Total AMPED * Total multiplier points)

### Boost Percentage

Multiplier points can significantly boost your APR:

Example:
- $1000 worth of AMPED with 10% ETH yield = $100 in ETH
- 20% multiplier points = additional $20 in ETH (20% boost)
- Maximum boost percentage: 200%
