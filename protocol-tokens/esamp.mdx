# esAMP Token

esAMP (escrowed AMP) is a non-transferable token that users can earn by staking AMP or ALP. It plays a crucial role in the Amped Finance ecosystem by incentivizing long-term participation and platform growth.

## Earning esAMP

Users can earn esAMP tokens through:
- Staking AMP tokens
- Staking ALP tokens
- Platform rewards and incentives

## Staking Benefits

When staked, esAMP tokens provide multiple benefits:

1. **Protocol Fee Sharing**
   - Participate in 30% of all generated protocol fees
   - This compounds with payments received from AMP/ALP staking

2. **Additional Rewards**
   - Earn additional escrowed AMP (esAMP) tokens
   - Compounds with esAMP received from AMP/ALP staking

3. **Multiplier Points**
   - Earn Multiplier Points (MP) that boost yield
   - Compounds with MPs received from AMP/ALP staking

## Vesting Process

esAMP tokens can be vested to convert them into AMP tokens:

1. During vesting:
   - AMP/ALP staked are reserved
   - esAMP stops accruing staking rewards
   - Staked AMP/ALP continues to accrue regular staking rewards

2. Conversion details:
   - 12-month vesting period
   - Vested esAMP gradually converts to AMP
   - Must maintain ALP in the pool to unlock vested esAMP

## Important Considerations

- esAMP is non-transferable
- Vesting requires maintaining staked assets
- Rewards compound with other staking benefits
- Vesting period is fixed at 12 months
