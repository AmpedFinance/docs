# Protocol Tokens

Amped Finance utilizes four main tokens to power its ecosystem:

## AMPED Token

The AMPED token is the platform's governance and utility token that allows holders to:
- Participate in protocol governance
- Earn rewards through staking
- Receive protocol fees
- Access additional platform features

[Learn more about AMPED](/protocol-tokens/amp/overview)

## esAMP Token

Escrowed AMP (esAMP) is earned through:
- Staking AMPED
- Staking ALP
- Platform rewards

esAMP can be:
- Staked for additional yields
- Vested to convert to AMPED over time

## ALP Token

ALP (Amped Liquidity Pool) serves as the liquidity provider token that:
- Represents a share in the platform's liquidity pool
- Earns fees from trading activities
- Can be staked for additional rewards
- Maintains price stability through its index mechanism

## yALP Token

yALP is a yield-bearing vault token that:
- Automatically compounds ALP rewards
- Provides transferable liquidity (unlike staked ALP)
- Follows the ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard
- Offers "set-and-forget" yield optimization

## Token Interactions

These tokens work together to create a sustainable ecosystem:
1. Traders pay fees in ETH
2. Fees are distributed to AMPED and ALP stakers
3. Stakers earn additional esAMP rewards
4. esAMP can be vested to AMPED
5. AMPED can be used for governance or restaked
6. ALP can be deposited into yALP for auto-compounding

## Reward Distribution

The protocol distributes rewards as follows:
- **70% to Liquidity Providers**: ALP holders receive the majority of trading fees
- **30% to Platform Participants**: Distributed to active users who engage with the platform

This dual reward system ensures both liquidity providers and ecosystem participants benefit from the platform's growth.
