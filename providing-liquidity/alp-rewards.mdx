# ALP Rewards

As an ALP token holder, you earn rewards from multiple sources. This page explains how rewards work and how to claim them.

## Reward Sources

ALP holders earn rewards from:

1. **Trading Fees**

   : A portion of all trading fees generated on the platform

2. **Liquidation Fees**

   : Fees collected from liquidated positions

3. **Swap Fees**

   : Fees from token swaps within the protocol

## Weekly Distribution Schedule

Rewards are distributed on a weekly basis following this process:

1. Platform fees are collected throughout the week

2. At the end of each week, fees are consolidated and prepared for distribution

3. Rewards are made available for claiming by ALP holders

4. The distribution amount is proportional to your share of the total ALP supply

## Reward Vesting

When you claim your rewards, they follow a vesting schedule:

* Rewards vest linearly over a 12-month period

* You can track your vesting progress in the dashboard

* Vested rewards can be claimed at any time

* Unvested rewards continue to vest as long as you maintain your ALP position
