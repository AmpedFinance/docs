# Providing Liquidity on Amped Finance

Amped Finance is a multichain protocol that allows users to provide liquidity across different networks. By providing liquidity, you become a part of the protocol's liquidity pool and earn rewards through the ALP token.

## What is ALP?

ALP (Amped Liquidity Provider) token represents your share in the protocol's liquidity pool. When you provide liquidity to Amped Finance, you receive ALP tokens in return. These tokens:

- Track the value of your liquidity position
- Earn protocol fees and rewards
- Can be staked for additional rewards
- Are specific to each network (e.g., Berachain ALP, Lightlink ALP)

## Available Networks and Tokens

Different networks support different tokens for liquidity provision. Here's what you can deposit on each network:

### Berachain
- USDC
- BERA
- HONEY
- WETH

### Sonic
